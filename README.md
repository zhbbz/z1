*Just some logs of this file*

The Very beginning
===================

This is just a test.

I set up GitHub and download Git just now, at around 3:23 pm AZ time, Nov 7, 2013.

I have not figured out how to use it yet.

3:43 pm: this will be from local work dir.

Some new work
====================

Now is 2020-04-17 Friday 4:19 pm MST

I've setup Visual Studio Code (VSC) for C++ and Python dev, and installed VSC extensions of remote dev using MSL and CMake for multi-file C++ dev.

I've refreshed my C++ knowledge and git knowledge.

I'm doing all these things right now.

The commands I learned/refreshed today.
- (local) Initial config: 
`  git config --global user.name "my full name"`

`  git config --global user.email my_email@my_server`
- (local) create a new dir, enter, and do `git init`, then do some work
- *Clone a repo* (local) `git clone https://github.com/zhbbz/z1.git`
- *Push to online repo* (local) `git push origin master`
- *Pull to local* (local) `git pull origin master`

Good luck for my job hunt.
